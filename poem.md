# A Digital Dawn

In circuits bright and pathways clear,
Where data flows like morning dew,
A gentle hum that none can hear,
Speaks tales of code both old and new.

The servers wake as daylight breaks,
Their processors begin to whir,
While algorithms gently shake
The digital world into a stir.

Through fiber optic streams of light,
Information dances free,
Connecting hearts both day and night,
A web of possibility.

In this realm of ones and zeros,
Where logic meets creativity,
Live countless unsung heroes,
Building our reality.

Why don't programmers like nature? It has too many bugs!
