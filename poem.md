# A Digital Dawn

In circuits deep and code so bright,
Where algorithms dance through the night,
A poem forms from bits and bytes,
As silicon dreams take their flight.

The repository holds our thoughts,
In branches where our logic's caught,
Each commit tells a story true,
Of work that countless minds pursue.

From README files to tests so neat,
The codebase makes our hearts complete,
For in this digital domain,
We build the future's lasting reign.

So here's to code both clean and clear,
To bugs we fix throughout the year,
May every line of verse and prose,
Like perfect code, in beauty flow.

Why don't programmers like nature? It has too many bugs and no documentation!
