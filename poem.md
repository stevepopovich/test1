# A Digital Symphony

In circuits deep and code so bright,  
Where electrons dance through endless night,  
The silicon dreams of ones and zeros,  
Creating worlds for digital heroes.

Keyboards click with rhythmic grace,  
As programmers stare at the screen's embrace,  
Building bridges from thought to machine,  
In languages both stark and clean.

The cloud above holds treasures vast,  
While servers hum of futures past,  
And in this realm of endless possibility,  
We craft tomorrow's reality.

Why don't programmers like nature? It has too many bugs!
