# The Coder's Symphony

In the quiet hum of midnight's glow,
Where keystrokes dance and ideas flow,
A world of logic comes alive,
Where ones and zeros learn to thrive.

Through loops that spin and functions call,
We build our dreams, both great and small,
Each bracket closed, each semicolon placed,
A symphony of thought, precisely traced.

We debug demons, chase the light,
Transform the darkness into bright,
With every line of code we write,
We paint the future, pixel-bright.

From silicon and circuits born,
A new creation every morn,
The coder's art, both science and soul,
Making broken systems whole.

So raise your coffee, dark and strong,
For in this craft we all belong,
Where creativity meets machine,
And possibilities unseen convene.

Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs!
