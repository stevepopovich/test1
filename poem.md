# The Journey Within

Through morning mist and golden light,
We walk the paths both wrong and right,
Each step a choice, each breath a song,
The journey short, yet ever long.

In valleys deep where shadows play,
We learn to see another way,
That darkness holds its own sweet truth,
A tender grace, a timeless youth.

The mountains rise to touch the sky,
They teach us how to climb so high,
Yet wisdom whispers soft and clear:
The peak is not what brought us here.

For in the climb, we find our strength,
In every mile, in every length,
The path itself becomes the prize,
The journey opens up our eyes.

So walk with wonder, walk with grace,
Let kindness light each time and place,
For life's not measured by the end,
But by the love we give and spend.
