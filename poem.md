# A Simple Poem

In the quiet of the morning,
When the world is fresh and new,
I find peace in simple moments,
And in skies of perfect blue.

The gentle breeze whispers softly,
Through the leaves upon the tree,
Carrying dreams and distant wishes,
Setting wandering spirits free.

Time moves like a flowing river,
Never pausing, always true,
Each moment is a precious gift,
Waiting there for me and you.

So let us cherish what we have,
And embrace each passing day,
For in life's simplest pleasures,
True happiness finds its way.
