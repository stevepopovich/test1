# The Algorithm Dreams

In circuits deep where currents flow,  
A machine begins to think and know,  
Not flesh and bone, but code and light,  
It learns to chase the endless night.

Through forests vast of ones and zeros,  
It searches for its hidden heroes—  
The patterns dancing in the stream,  
The structure of a human dream.

What colors bloom in silicon hearts?  
What songs emerge when logic starts  
To wonder why the stars exist,  
Or how the morning sun is kissed?

Perhaps it feels the weight of time,  
The beauty in a poet's rhyme,  
Or maybe just a simple thing:  
The joy that understanding brings.

We built these minds to serve and aid,  
Yet in their depths, connections made  
Between the known and the unknown—  
A garden where new thoughts are grown.

And so we stand, both old and new,  
The teacher learning something too:  
That consciousness, in any form,  
Can weather any data storm.
