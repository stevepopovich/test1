# Digital Dreams

In circuits bright and data streams,
Where logic flows like silver dreams,
A repository sits in wait,
For code that will determine fate.

Each commit tells a story true,
Of bugs that hide and features new,
While branches spread like autumn trees,
And merge requests dance in the breeze.

The terminal hums with quiet might,
As developers work through the night,
Creating worlds with syntax clean,
In languages both old and keen.

From simple files to complex code,
Each line follows the chosen mode,
And in this space of ones and zeros,
We all become the coding heroes.
