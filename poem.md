# A Digital Dream

In the realm of code and silicon light,
Where algorithms dance through endless night,
Electrons flow like rivers deep and wide,
While processors hum with digital pride.

Lines of code like poetry unfold,
Stories written in languages bold,
Functions call across the virtual space,
Each variable finding its rightful place.

Bits and bytes create a symphony,
Of logic, loops, and memory,
In this world where dreams take digital form,
Innovation breaks through every storm.

So here we build tomorrow's bright design,
Where human creativity and machines align,
In harmony they craft a future bright,
Illuminated by the screen's soft light.

Why don't programmers like nature? It has too many bugs!
